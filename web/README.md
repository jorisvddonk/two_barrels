# Two Barrels

Perhaps one day a neat FPS game.

Very WIP, very ugly.

Some code based on [martinsik/dart-webgl-tutorials](https://github.com/martinsik/dart-webgl-tutorials), [learning webgl](http://learningwebgl.com/blog/?p=571) and [xNotch/dark](https://github.com/xNotch/dark) (collision code). Inspired by [xibalba](http://phoboslab.org/xibalba/).
Uses some textures from the TRaK5 textureset (see assets/trak5/readme.md)
